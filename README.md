# Securty-password--code

	Security-yahoo parses the orignal yahoo.txt for only
	the username and password, leaving out top and bottom

	Security-Linkedin is my attempt to crack as many of
	the passwords in Linkedin.txt.

	Security-Formspring is my attempt to crack the 
	formspring.txt which is a prepended 2 digit salted 
	sha256 hash.
